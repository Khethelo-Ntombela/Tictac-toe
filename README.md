# Tictac-toe
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C#. It allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

Features:
Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).
3x3 grid for marking moves.
Real-time winner and tie detection.
Simple and user-friendly console interface.

How to Play:
The game will prompt Player X to enter a number (1-9) to place their mark.
After X, Player O takes their turn in the same way.
The game checks for a winner after each move.

The game will end if:
One player wins by forming a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
All spots are filled with no winner (tie).

Example of the Game Board:
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6

 7 | 8 | 9
To mark a spot, simply enter the number corresponding to the position.
